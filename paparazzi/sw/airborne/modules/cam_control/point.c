 *  \brief Determines camera pan and tilt angles.

 * project:        Paparazzi
 * description:    Determines camera pan and tilt angles from
 *                 plane's and object's positions and plane's
 *                 pitch and roll angles. Software might be optimized
 *                 by removing multiplications with 0, it is left this
 *                 way for better understandabilty and changeability.

 *
 * hardware:
 *
 * The camera control is made of normal servos. Usually servos have a
 * turn angle of about 90°. This is changed electrically so that they
 * can do a 180°. It is achieved by adding two serial resistors at both
 * sides of the potentiometer (P1), one for increasing the usable angle
 * (R1) and the other for moving the middle position to a useful angle
 * (R2). Therefore a servo with a 270° potentiometer is needed. Very
 * small and light servos have 180° potentiometers, these do not allow
 * a 180° degrees sweep. Cut the outer two connections between the
 * potentiometer and the board to insert the resistors. The values for
 * R1 and R2 should be found out by testing as there might be serial
 * resistors on the servo board that affect the values. Start with
 * about 1/2 the value of P1 for R1 and change R1 until you get a
 * little more than 180° sweep. Then insert and modify R2 to set
 * neutral back to the middle position of the potentiometer.
